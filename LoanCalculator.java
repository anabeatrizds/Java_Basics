/*Loan Calculator

You take a loan from a friend and need to calculate how much you will owe him after 3 months.
You are going to pay him back 10% of the remaining loan amount each month.
Create a program that takes the loan amount as input, calculates and outputs the remaining amount after 3 months.

Sample Input:
20000

Sample Output:
10628

Here is the monthly payment schedule:
Month 1
Payment: 10% of 20000 = 2000
Remaining amount: 18000
Month 2
Payment: 10% of 18000 = 1800
Remaining amount: 16200
Month 3:
Payment: 10% of 16200 = 1620
Remaining amount: 14580
